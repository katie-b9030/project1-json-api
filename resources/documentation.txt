1.  What dataset are you using? (If not one of the provided ones, where did you get it?)
    I am using a Disney Movies JSON dataset found from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sooaaib/walt-disney-movies?select=disney_movies.json.

2.  What went right in the development of this project?
    I was able to create my client page and establish the skeletons of my json responses with very little trouble.

3.  What went wrong in the development of this project?
    I kept running into errors trying to send my post requests, and I also hit problems tyring to get query parameters to populate in my url (I ended up having to add them manually).

4.  What did you learn while developing this project?
    I learned that it's ok to ask for help, and if you're having issues with something sometimes all you need is a break and/or a new perspective.

5.  If you went above and beyond, how did you do so?
    I didn't really go above and beyond, although I added a few small flares to my styling. I also have one more endpoint than required.

6.  If you used any borrowed code or code fragments, where did you get them from? What do the code fragments do? Where are they in your code?
    All borrowed code fragments are commented in my code.
    One fragment I got from ChatGPT beause I was getting a no-param-reassign error when trying to add movie ratings (jsonResponses.js). Basically, it uses array destructuring to assign the original object plus the new parameter back to the original parsed JSON.
    The other fragment I got from https://coryrylan.com/blog/css-tips-vertical-line-rule#:~:text=Using%20CSS%20Flexbox%2C%20we%20can,and%20fill%20the%20parent%20container (styles.css). That fragment turns my <hr> tags into vertical dividers between my flex items.
