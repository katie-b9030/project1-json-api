1.  What dataset are you using? (If not one of the provided ones, where did you get it?)
    I am using a Disney Movies JSON dataset found from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sooaaib/walt-disney-movies?select=disney_movies.json.

2.  What work has been completed for this milestone?
    I have created the client page, set up references to several of the sections and buttons, and started creating the client functions. I set up all html responses, have a first draft of each of the get/head functions, a skeleton for the post functions, and have a functioning 404 page.

3.  What work is left, and how do you plan to complete it?
    I need to polish the get functions and work on parsing my json better, refactor my code to not repeat, implement the proper functionality for creating a new json file to hold the favorites, and implement my client-side functions. I also need to refactor my post functions to handle x-www-form-urlencoded format.
    I'm planning to try to implement everything on my own by the end of next weekend so I have time to ask questions and go to office hours before the deadline next Wednesday if I need to.

4.  Do you have a plan for going above and beyond? If so, what is it?
    I'm hoping to give a great enhancement css, maybe add in a css framework and make all the endpoints visible/invisible based on which button is pressed to determine which endpoint is used.

5.  If you used any borrowed code or code fragments, where did you get them from? What do the code fragments do? Where are they in your code?
    Currently I do not have any borrowed code or fragments. Some of my code is inspired/copied from other projects we have completed, but that's it.
